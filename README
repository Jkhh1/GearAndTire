This project is both strange and interesting.  I wrote back in 1996 using
Java 1.0 as a project when I was working on my masters.  It was also pretty
much my first object oriented project.  I was trying to illustrate some
points and utilize certain features of Java, so there are some other
slightly strange parts of the code because of this.

Keeping all that in mind, the code is still actually very useful.  I've had
it up on my web site for the last 14 years and it still gets used.  This
might be my longest living piece of code.
