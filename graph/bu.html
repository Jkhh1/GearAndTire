<h2>How to use this applet</h2><br>

This applet draw three tipes of graph from the data file.
<ul>
<li>choose the type of the graph ( Line,Rectangle,Circle ) 
<li>Input the number into the textfield.
<ul>
<li>	if you chose Line or Rect for kind, input the number that represent the kind of data.)
<li>	or else you chose Circle for kind, input the number that represent time plot
</ul>
<li>click "submit" to draw the graph.
<li>click "clear" to clean the display.
</ul>
This is the developed version of graph drawing applet NF4.

<a href="NF4.java">Source code</a> is available, but is still messy. Since this is the first applet I've written.<br>
I found one bag. Sometimes the window for choosing the kind of graph doesn't appear. In this case just try to ckick beside the text field, the window might appear then.
