<P>
The document is a user guide for the Gear and Tire Applet.  The first section
describes general use of the applet and the other sections contain more specific
information about
<A HREF="tire.html">tires</A>,
<A HREF="trans.html">transmissions</A>,
<A HREF="xfer.html">transfer cases</A>, and
<A HREF="rnp.html">ring and pinion</A>,
The general section covers what the Gear and Tire Applet is and what it can be
used for.  It also covers general information on ratios and the input and output
of the Gear and Tire Applet.


<H2>What is the Gear and Tire Applet?</H2>
<P>
The gear and tire form is designed to assist you making gear and tire selections
for your four wheel drive vehicle.  Larger tires gain ground clearance, increase
maximum fording depth, and increase the angles of departure and approach, but
they often don't work well with OEM gearing.  Auto manufactures build trucks
for the street, which means they select high gearing for fast acceleration
and better gas milage.  When larger tires are put on these trucks, the driver
may find themselves burning through clutches because first gear is so high.
Engine performance and gas milage may suffer because the engine is forced to
work outside of it's optimal RPM ranges.  Top speed on the highway will
increase, but so will low speed on the trail.
<P>
There are two main motivations to regear, the first is to return the truck to
the manufactures operating ranges to improve engine performance and decrease
wear and tear on the clutch and transmission.  The second is to increase
offroad performance with lower gearing.  Lower gearing allows the offroader
to go slower through obstacles giving the driver better control so there is
less chance of vehicle damage and occupant injury.  There is a penalty for
low gears on top highway cruising speed.  The gear and tire form is designed
to allow the user to try different configurations and see what performance
will be like for different configurations before going through an expensive
gear swap.


<H2>General Information on Gear Ratios</H2>
<P>
One important aspect of gear ratios is numerically large gears are the low
ones.  Gear ratios are normally stated in the form x.xx:1, e.g. 6.32:1.  This
translates mathematically to 1/6.32, and since 1/2 is more than 1/6, 6:1 is
lower than 2:1.  The ratio means that for every 6.32 revolutions from the
input the output will rotate once.  This happens to be granny low first gear
on a Ford T-18 transmission.  When you are in first with the T-18, the engine
does 6.32 revolutions for every 1 revolution the transmissions outputs.
Fourth gear on the T-18 is 1.00:1, so for every revolution of the engine, it
outputs one revolution.


<H2>Input for the Gear and Tire Applet</H2>
<P>
The Gear and Tire Applet takes as input your tire size, transmission ratios,
transfer case low range, and ring and pinion.
<P>
The tire field will accept input in English or metric sizes.  The entire
metric size must be input to calculate diameter, but the prefix 'P' or 'LT'
are optional.  For example the tire size P225/75R15 could be entered without
the 'P'.  For English sizes, the gear and tire form is only interested in
the diameter in inches.  The rest is not needed, but if it is typed it will
be ignored.  For example '32x11.50R15LT M+S' can be just entered 32.
<P>
Input of Transmission ratios, transfer case low range, and ring and pinion
all have the same basic form.  The Gear and Tire Applet is looking for the
ratios and ratios are commonly expressed in the form x.xx:1.  To save some
typing the ':1' part does not need to be entered.  You can enter it if you
like but, it will be ignored.  If you have tooth counts, for ring and pinion
for example, just divide the big number by the small.  For example 41/10
ring and pinion translate to 4.10:1.
<P>
The user has the option to produce output in kilometers per hour or miles
per hour.  No output is produced until the 'calculate' button is pressed.
This document is available by pressing the 'help' button.


<H2>Output for the Gear and Tire Applet</H2>
<P>
When the calculate button is pressed
output is created in both graphical and tabular form.  The graph is a line
graph with RPM on the x-axis ranging from 0 to 4000 RPM.  The y-axis is either
MPH or KPH depending on user input.  MPH range from 0 to 80 MPH.  KPH range
from 0 to 120 KPH.  Each transmission gear is printed out as a seperate
line in the graph first being red, second blue, third green, fourth black,
and fifth yellow.  A check box at the botton of the graph allows the user
to "shift" the transfer case into low range.  The title of the graph gives
the users tire size and ring and pinion ratio.
<P>
The tabular output is also produced each time the calculate button is
pressed.  The title on the tabular output indicates the units of output
either KPH or MPH.  It also indicates the users selection of tire and
ring and pinion and allows the user to enter different RPMs to see the
table at various engine outputs.  Each row of the table represents a
gear of the transmission first, second, third and so forth.  The columns
represent high and low range of the transfer case.
<P>
The crawl ratio, which is often used to compare gearing set ups,
is also included in the tabular output.  The crawl ratio represents
compound low, or first gear of the transmission and low range of the
transfer case.  For example, many Wranglers have a first gear around
3.83:1, the transfer case low range is 2.72:1, and the axle ring and
pinion is 3.07:1.  This means the crawl ratio is 3.83*2.72*3.07 or around
32:1.  Put some big tires on that Wrangler and it will be difficult to
control on a technical trail.  A crawl ratio around 60:1 is often good
target.
