<P>
When I began developing ideas for this project back in October of 1995, Java
was really beginning to bloom.  Netscape had a beta version of the Navigator
that supported Java, but it wasn't mainstream yet.  I had already been working
on some ideas using 'C' and I knew I'd have very little time to work on the
project during the next semester due to travel.  I decided to go ahead and
develop the project in 'C' so I could be done by Febuary of 1996.  I was
about 80% done development when I ran out of time and had to apply for an
extension.  When I got back in June of 1996, it seemed silly to finish the
project in 'C' since Java had taken the world by storm.  I decided to learn
Java and rewrite the project in Java.  It took a while, but it was worth
learning the language and I discovered some interesting advantages Java
has over the old CGI method.
<P>
First, this paper covers an overview of what the package does and how
it will be used. Next, the 'C' version of the project will be discussed
since a lot of time was put into it and to make CGI Java comparisons.
Lastly, some interesting features of Java that were used to develop the
final version of the package will be discussed.

<H1>The Gear and Tire Applet</H1>
A full version of the Users Guide for the Gear and Tire Applet is included
in Appendix A, so here we will just give an overview of the product, why
it was developed, and what it will be used for.

<H2>What is the Gear and Tire Applet?</H2>
<P>
The Gear and Tire Applet is designed to assist the user in making gear and
tire selections for their four wheel drive vehicle.  Larger tires gain
ground clearance, increase
maximum fording depth, and increase the angles of departure and approach, but
they often don't work well with OEM gearing.  Auto manufactures build trucks
for the street, which means they select high gearing for fast acceleration
and better gas milage.  When larger tires are put on these trucks, the driver
may find themselves burning through clutches because first gear is so high.
Engine performance and gas milage may suffer because the engine is forced to
work outside of it's optimal RPM ranges.  Top speed on the highway will
increase, but so will low speed on the trail.
<P>
There are two main motivations to regear, the first is to return the truck to
the manufactures operating ranges to improve engine performance and decrease
wear and tear on the clutch and transmission.  The second is to increase
offroad performance with lower gearing.  Lower gearing allows the offroader
to go slower through obstacles giving the driver better control so there is
less chance of vehicle damage and occupant injury.  There is a penalty for
low gears on top highway cruising speed.  The gear and tire form is designed
to allow the user to try different configurations and see what performance
will be like for different configurations before going through an expensive
gear swap.
<P>
Basically, the user inputs tire size, transmission gear ratios, transfer
case gear ratio, and ring and pinion ratio in a screen that looks like
the screen in figure A. Once the calculate button is pressed, tabular and
graphical output is produced depiciting the MPH at different engine RPMs.
The graph uses different colors for each gear of the transmission and the
graph and table can be found in figure B.

<H2>What will the Gear and Tire Applet be used for?</H2>
There is a demand in the Internet off road community for this information.
Four wheel drive enthusists are always looking for this information to help
them make gear and tire selections for their trucks.  Several people have
developed spread sheets to generate this information, but until now no one
has created a Java version.  It also features graphical output which hasn't
been done before.  Dean Waters, the web master of the Offroad page at
<A HREF="http://www.off-road.com/4x4web">http://www.off-road.com/</A>, has
agreed to host the application permanently.

<H1>The 'C' Gear and Tire Form</H1>
The 'C' version of the Gear and Tire form got as far as generating tabular
output.  The biggest problem I had with it was getting someone to host the
executable.  In my previous job at AT&T I was web master for my group, so
I was able to set the program up locally and test it, but due to AT&Ts
firewall, no one outside AT&T had access to it.  Because of security
considerations, the administrators at NJIT were justifiable concerned
about allowing the program to run.  Since I had a good friend at Tulane
University with connections in the computer department, it was easier to
get it set up there, were it still runs today at

<P>
The purpose of the package is the same, but the interface is a bit different.
When this package was developed, my browser didn't have frames or windowing
capabilities.  The user inputs two sets of values, side by side so one
call to the CGI script will do the calculation and produce output to compare
two different configurations.  This makes the input screen a bit busy and
slightly confusing.  The input screen for the 'C' version is displayed in
figure C.

<BR>
The busy part is the "Current Tire" and "Desired Tire" part.  Same for the
current and desired R&P.  It is just a bit confusing to the user.  The rest
of the layout seems straight forward enough.  If the 'C' version was modified
to use frames the unnecessary complexity could be avoided.
<P>
The output also suffers from some unnecessary complexity that could be
avoided with frames or by spawning widows.  A sample output follows in
figure D.
