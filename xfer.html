<CENTER><H1>Gear and Tire Applet User Guide: Tranfer Case</H1></CENTER>
It wouldn't be four wheel drive without a transfer case.  The transfer
case transfers power from the transmission to the rear and front axles.
Typically, the driver has 2 high, 4 high, neutral, and 4 low.  The Gear
and Tire Applet supports the standard two speed transfer cases.  If you
have a three speed transfer case, you'll have to enter the ratios
separately.
<P>
High range is assumed to be 1:00:1 for 2 high and 4 high.  Low range is
input by the user.  Low range is typically around 2.50:1.
